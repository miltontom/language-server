# Language Server

This is a language server project that I'm building from scratch without any external dependencies and only using python's stdlib.

## Motivation

My curiosity about how code completion and other language support features work in code editors like VS Code and Neovim led me to build my own language server from scratch as a learning experience and to improve my skills as a developer.

## Goal
Build a language server  

* **for**: LÃ–VE 2D framework  
* **with**: Python  
* **over**: STDIO  
* **supporting:** code-completion  
* **for client**: Neovim  

## Progress

* [ ] Handle basic server lifecycle messages
